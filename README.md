# Day Planner

### About the Application
This application is a function work day scheduler, where the user can input data into each block of time to manage their work day. When the user clicks the save icon, their information is saved and will be displayed when the page is refreshed. Each hour is color-coded depending on if it is in the past, present, or future.

*Note: I changed the time in the code to read 12 PM to demonstrate the functionality of the color blocks.
